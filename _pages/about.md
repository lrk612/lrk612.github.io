I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in Electronic & Communication Engineering (ECE) at Shenzhen International Graduate School, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of Prof. [Qingmin Liao](https://dblp.org/pid/13/322).

Before that, I received my B.S. in Electronic Information Engineering *with honors* from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in June 2023.

Currently, I am a research intern at [Future Intelligence laB](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kmgzPeQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Dr. [Huandong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PNbioq0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

**Research:** My research focuses on physics-inspired deep learning. I am dedicated to integrating physical knowledge into representation learning to understand complex physical phenomena, including [invariant variable representation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3580305.3599858), [network dimensionality reduction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3637528.3671968), [energy landscapes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PxRATSTDlS), and multiscale structures (under review). 
Recently, my interests have centered on improving the accuracy and generalization of complex system predictions through generative AI, such as diffusion models.
